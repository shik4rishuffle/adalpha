  - I Have created the basic folder structure
  - created the git repository (https://github.com/shik4rishuffle/adalpha
.git)
  - installed vue-cli with the webpack template including Jest testing, dev and prod build processes, and eslint.
  - began configuring the eslint to keep my codebase up to a good standard. found this pretty helpful guide on best 
  practices and style guides with Vue.js (https://itnext.io/how-to-structure-a-vue-js-project-29e4ddc1aeeb)
  - configured the webpack config to support webpack 4 and build for vue

    - I have only added in 4 pages. the app should not be overly complicated and easy to use so I want to show this by keeping it minimalistic
    - I have only added in a couple of the obvious components for now. due to my limited knowledge of using vue with GO I am going to add more as they become necessary.
  - Add in view to Router
